# Bio Organic App

The Bio Organic App aims to present a natural alternative to non-healthy, industrialized chemical foods that have become one of today's most pressing problems. Users online can easily get the stuff they need with this app.
The products are divided into different categories so that they can be targeted and find easily. Each food contains important information such as detailed information about it, rules of usage, place of manufacture, duration of use and so on. Buyers have the right to comment on it after receiving the food.

##### Intended User
This program is especially designed for adolescents and older people. Some of the foods may be dangerous for health if they are not properly used. For this reason, it is not recommended for younger people to order some products by using this app.

## Note:

The app gets data from the backend firebase real-time database. However, in case of not sharing sensitive data like API key and etc, I have extracted the data to the `mock-data.json` file. To be able to test the app you should import the file into your own firebase account and then connect the app to it.

## Attention!
The data inside `mock-data.json` file is fake and is aimed to use only for test usage and only for Udacity reviewers. It is not allowed to use the these data in anywhere else!
