Both interpretations point to key qualities of this herb.&nl&nl  Thyme, a short shrub native to southern Europe, features some of the tiniest leaves in the garden. Despite its small stature, tiny thyme has served as a symbol for strength and bravery among many cultures for thousands of years.",

      "description" : "Organic Bay leaves, Laurus nobilis, are from the family Lauraceae (laurel family). Other closely related members of this species include Cinnamomum (cinnamon) and Persea (avocado). The vast majority of the Lauraceae species are different from the other families of Laurales, as they possess leaves that are whorled (the leaves radiate from a single point and surround or wrap around the stem), although a few have opposite leaves. The species tends to be strongly aromatic because of the amount of essential oil found in the bark, leaves and wood.&nl&nl  Indigenous to Asia and the Mediterranean, bay leaves are rarely used fresh. Dried bay leaves have a more pleasant, sweeter taste than fresh and the flavor becomes more intense the longer it cooks. We've looked at numerous bay leaf suppliers and found our current supplier's organic bay leaves to be far superior, not only in color and flavor, but in having more whole leaves.&nl&nl  There are approximately 132 bay leaves per ounce.&nl  Dried bay leaf has higher essential oil than the fresh version at between .6% and 10%, mostly 1,8-cineole.

      "description" : "Urfa Biber Chiles are indigenous to the area around the city of Sanlıurfa in southeastern Turkey which is typically referred to as Urfa in his region. The word “Biber” translates to \"pepper\" in Turkish. This dried Turkish chile is from the species Capsicum annuum and is also known as”Isot pepper”.&nl&nl  Technically a red chile pepper, Urfa Biber matures to a bright red when it is then harvested and cured or dried for a week. The two step drying process is similar to that of top grade vanilla beans as during the day they are laid out to be sun dried and at night they are wrapped tightly. This process is commonly known as “sweating” and it infuses the remaining moisture of the chile with chile’s flesh. The resulting color is a dark blackish-purple.&nl&nl  The flavor profile of the Urfa Chile is well rounded and complex with a smoky earthy edge and undertones of coffee, chocolate, tobacco and raisins. The flavor and heat is similar to the region’s other star chile the Aleppo Pepper which is grown only a mountain range away in Syria. Considered a medium heat chile this comes in at 6,000-8,000 SHU (Scoville Heat Units) and their heat is surprising as they start off a bit mild but then almost seem to increase in heat and intensity as the meal progresses.",

Older varieties are commercially grown in the Middle Eastern regions of Turkey, India, Iran and Morocco. Our Pink Rose Petals are cultivated in India. The majority of these flowers are destined for rose water but some of these beautifully scented flowers will find a place in kitchens around the world.&nl&nl  The use of flowers in cooking, while maybe not instantly recognizable, is really not all that uncommon - hibiscus, jasmine and lavender immediately come to mind.
